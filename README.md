# ECE391_SP23
This repository contains the three machine projects (MPs) that I worked on for my ECE391 Class.

MP1: Using x86 assembly for a hands-on implementation of a fish animation. 

MP2: Implement a maze game. 

MP3: Implement a linux kernel with a filesystem, device support, executes programs and even has multiple terminals.

MP3 is the capstone project for this class, where we are tasked with creating an x86-based operating system from the ground up within a span of 6 weeks. Usually there are groups of 4 but due to special circumstances I was in a group of 2. We completed all required deliverables and achieved a 94% grade for this MP.

Here is an example of the completed MP: https://brokeos.site/
